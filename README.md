# adventofcode2018
My www.adventofcode.com 2018 solutions. This time in Haskell. Never really used
Haskell before. This is going to be fun!

## Some design concepts
- **Minimal:** Nothing fancy, no shared libraries, every solution should be in
  a single haskell file
- **Documented:** Make sure I (and others) understand the code in 5 years
  from now
- **Test driven:** Add the unit tests from the website, and center development
  around solving the tests first
- **Easy to understand:** Not aiming for the most fancy and artful programs, but
  rather easy to understand while still properly using concepts from the haskell
